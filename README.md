## How to Use

If you want to replicate my findings or otherwise explore the data on your own, you'll need to have python (v3+), numpy, pandas, ggplot, and jupyter installed on your machine. Then run `jupyter notebook` inside this directory.

Under the `docs/` directory, you will also find the website code for the interactive map of the data.
