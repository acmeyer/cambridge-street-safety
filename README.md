# Cambridge Street Safety Data Analysis

A look at street safety in Cambridge, MA.

## How to Use

If you want to replicate my findings or otherwise explore the data on your own, you'll need to have python (v3+), numpy, pandas, ggplot, and jupyter installed on your machine. Then run `jupyter notebook` inside this directory.

Under the `docs/` directory, you will also find the website code for the interactive map of the data. You can also view the site here: https://acmeyer.github.io/cambridge-street-safety.
